I am a second-year student at The Ohio State University majoring in computer science within the College of Engineering. Aside from my major, I am also an [International Affairs Scholar](https://honors-scholars.osu.edu/scholars/programs/ia) and taking part in the [Second-year Transformational Experience Program](https://step.osu.edu/). Additionally, I am a member of the [Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers](http://org.osu.edu/sase/) and the Taiwanese American Student Association, as well as being an undergraduate research assistant.

Professionally, I am interested in the development of accessible software and data organization, through software development, web development, machine learning, artificial intelligence and more. Some of my personal interests include learning my heritage language, photography, working out, and trying new foods!
